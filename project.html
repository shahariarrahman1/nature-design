                    <p>At present, the general consensus that "natural", "green", "organic", and "clean" means better is ubiquitous within the beauty industry and frankly speaking, it makes a lot of sense. Buzzwords used by cosmetics and skincare companies to shift products; they promise eco-friendly alternatives that seem to be an obvious solution to reducing the impact our beauty routines are having on the planet.

                    With "natural" the most googled among them (followed swiftly by "without preservatives" and "cruelty-free"), and a 2019 study by Statista revealing 58% of women in the US seek these components when shopping for beauty, one can pretty much gauge the popularity of such products, products that promise to work wonders for our skin, all whilst "saving the planet".
                    
                    

                    Widely believed that they are less polluting, as well as being gentler on our complexions, natural beauty products are undoubtedly the go-to option for conscious consumers more aware than ever before of what they’re putting on their faces. 
                    
                    And with high-profile celebrities including Miranda Kerr, Jessica Alba, and Gwyneth Paltrow frequently touting the use of items free of harmful chemicals, it isn’t difficult to understand why the movement encouraging us to go "au naturale"has gained so much traction.
                    
                    The terms, however — while suggestive of being good for both us and the environment — have a tendency to be a little misleading, particularly "natural" which is a relatively broad word, one with no real concrete, recognised definition. For starters, it isn’t currently regulated. With no official standard in place guaranteeing quality and protecting against fraudulent claims, products can be labelled "natural" even if they only contain a minute percentage of natural ingredients.</p>
